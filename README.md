Optimized Paper is a [Pterodactyl Paper](https://pterodactyl.io) egg, and it's made to optimize a Minecraft server running on [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) to be fast as possible without you needing to do anything.

## Installation

**This is easy,** just [download](https://github.com/TIKU121/optimized-paper/releases) the egg and navigate to the `Nests` section of your admin panel and from there click the **green Import Egg** button, upload the egg and then choose the `Minecraft` nest. **You must restart your daemon, if you are using v0.7.**

## Contributing

**Help make Minecraft servers run faster and better for everyone.** Pull requests are welcome as long as the changes are **not game breaking and actually work.**
