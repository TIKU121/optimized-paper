# Optimized Paper Egg

**Optimized Paper is a [Pterodactyl Panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) egg, which is specialized to make it possible to run Minecraft servers in low RAM/CPU environments, and also to overall make it as optimized without the user having to do anything.**

## Installation

Please follow this wonderful [guide](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs#how-to-import-an-egg), which also works on most other Pterodactyl egg installations. **If you are new to the Pterodactyl Panel, I strongly recommend the newest version of the panel as it's easier to install and modify eggs on it.**
