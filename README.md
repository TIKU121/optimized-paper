## Installation

**This is easy,** just [download](https://github.com/TIKU121/optimized-paper/releases) the egg and navigate to the `Nests` section of your admin panel and from there click the **green Import Egg** button, upload the egg and then choose the `Minecraft` nest. **You must restart your daemon, if you are using v0.7.**
